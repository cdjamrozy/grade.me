# Grade.Me
A better interface for students and instructors to view and enter grades.

## Students
Students can 
- Get a visual representation of grades in all classes over time
- View all upcoming and past assignments
- Get information on upcoming assignments and submit them
- Contact the instructor
- Get detailed statistics and a visual represntation of how they did on past assignments and exams
- See their overall progress in a class compared to the rest of the students
- Use a grade predictor to interactively see how upcoming assignments can impact their overall grade

## Instructors
Instructors can
- Enter in grades for all students and get real time visualization of those grades
- View in depth statistics for the class on past assignments and exams
- Get a graphical representation of how students in the class are doing
- Interactively adjust grades if needed

Currently, the site has no bkck-end and is just an interactive prototype for the interface. I hope to add a back end to make the site actually useable in the future.
